# Academic Paper Summarizer using RAG

This project was developed as part of the Intel® Unnati Industrial Training Program (Gen AI for Gen Z).

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build an academic paper summarization system that demonstrates real engineering effort using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles. Instead of passing entire documents to a language model, the system performs chunking, vector-based retrieval, and explicit context compression before summarization.

## Pipeline
1. Document Loading
2. Text Chunking
3. Vector Embedding (TF-IDF)
4. Similarity-based Retrieval (Cosine Similarity)
5. Context Compression
6. Final Summarization
